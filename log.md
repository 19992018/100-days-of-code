# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: November 14, 2023 
### Project: High School
Today I was to start by working on the frontend. I expected to complete at least a half a web page.
Using bootstrap however slowed down my pace of progress. Apparently I am not as efficient with bootstrap as I thought I would be. I fumbled for hours trying to align the header elements. I was trying to achieve CSSâ€™s justify content space-between. Eventually I realised I was using a bootstrap class (container-fluid) in an improper manner thus the content would just not justify with a space between. I realised this after reading the Bootstrap documentation, which was really helpful compared to the Traversy Media crash course.

## Day 1: November 16, 2023
### Project: High School
Worked on the website's carousel as well as the welcome message (The landing page in general). 

The images on the carousel were a bit hard to size. However, adding a height, to particular divs solved the issue. 

I also used display-flex to position the elements within the landing-page section. However, Mark advised me to add a class of row instead. And that enabled the elements within the section to still display side by side.

It has all in all been a successful day. Tomorrow I polish the landing page and majorly work on the Sign Up/Sign In Page.

## Day 2: November 20, 2023
### Project: High School- Modal
#### 11 to 12noon
This is actually day 3. Sigh! Im indicating it as day 2 because the on actual day 2 I didn't make much progress. I mean I did a quite a lot towards the project but there was not much visible progress. I worked on the modal but using html and javascript; not bootstrap as I am supposed to. This should be the very last time I am making such an entry. All work towards this challenge must be recorded.

So, about today... I worked on the modal that contains the sign in form. It was a bit of a challenge at first getting the modal to appear since the bootstrap documentation was not up to date with the version. I got to know this from stack overflow. Eg. "data-toggle" does not work anymore on modals; it should be "data-bs-toggle".

Besides that little in hitch getting the modal to work, I feel that bootstrap is really convenient since the sign-in page/modal was cute and pre-made. I feel that once I familiarize myself with all the classes and elements Bootstrap will be really convenient to use. Tho I kinda miss CSS. I had gotten so comfortable with it. But still I feel Bootstrap will be an asset once I get comfortable with it.

Im going on a break now. I might pick up from where Ive left after the break or do something else. Either way Ill write the update of what Ive been up to here.

### Project: High School- About Page
#### 2 to 4 pm
I worked on the about page. I initially thought of using ejs to make the about page but I thought it would complicate things so I continued with Bootstrap.

On the bright side I figured out that the node modules folder is only visible once express is installed. I was wondering why I couldnt see the node modules folder despite having installed npm.

Its been an okay session all in all.

Tomorrow I finish up the mock ups to get a sense of direction, add a footer to the pages and also develop another page.
