# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: November 14, 2023 
### Project: High School
Today I was to start by working on the frontend. I expected to complete at least a half a web page.
Using bootstrap however slowed down my pace of progress. Apparently I am not as efficient with bootstrap as I thought I would be. I fumbled for hours trying to align the header elements. I was trying to achieve CSSâ€™s justify content space-between. Eventually I realised I was using a bootstrap class (container-fluid) in an improper manner thus the content would just not justify with a space between. I realised this after reading the Bootstrap documentation, which was really helpful compared to the Traversy Media crash course.

## Day 1: November 16, 2023
### Project: High School
Worked on the website's carousel as well as the welcome message (The landing page in general). 

The images on the carousel were a bit hard to size. However, adding a height, to particular divs solved the issue. 

I also used display-flex to position the elements within the landing-page section. However, Mark advised me to add a class of row instead. And that enabled the elements within the section to still display side by side.

It has all in all been a successful day. Tomorrow I polish the landing page and majorly work on the Sign Up/Sign In Page.
