# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 14, 2023 
Today I was to start by working on the frontend. I expected to complete at least a half a web page.
Using bootstrap however slowed down my pace of progress. Apparently I am not as efficient with bootstrap as I thought I would be. I fumbled for hours trying to align the header elements. I was trying to achieve CSSâ€™s justify content space-between. Eventually I realised I was using a bootstrap class (container-fluid) in an improper manner thus the content would just not justify with a space between. I realised this after reading the Bootstrap documentation, which was really helpful compared to the Traversy Media crash course.
